          <h1>Vela</h1>
          <p>A responsive web application that gives real-time weather, wind
      and wave predicitons, with up-to-date algae reports. Users can check the
      reports of their desired location, catch up on the latest news or current
      trends and share their experiences with others.</p>

          <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
          <span>Our weather app users need a way to check current weather related
      predictions because they need to ensure their safety for the day they chose
      to participate in a water related activity or sport.
      We will know this to be true when we see how many users are checking the
      current weather conditions.</span>
          <h4>My Role</h4>
          <span>Researcher - Interviewer - Designer</span>
          <h4>Tools Used</h4>
          <span>Adobe XD - Balsamiq - Procreate - Google Forms - Pen - Paper</span>
          <h4>Duration</h4>
          <span>10 months</span>
          <p>
            Start Date : February 2021 - End Date : November 2021
          </p>
          <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
          <p>To understand the market for applications that predict the weather
      for water sports I needed to conduct a competitive analysis of pre-existing
      applications. I chose Surfline and SailFlow for their similarity in function
      and their popularity amongst users.</p>
          <h3>Surfline</h3>
          <h4>Overview :</h4>
          <span>While Surfline is no doubt a top-dog in marine weather forecasting,
      it seems to really only cater to the needs of surfers and fisherman.
      However, being a weall-known source some users feel it has lost its
      oringinality and become too commercial.</span>
          <h4>Key Objectives :</h4>
          <span>"Connecting people with their passion." Surfline/Wavetrak has been
      a long standing network used by surfers and boaters alike. Having their
      own products and a team of expert meteorologists and scientists adds an
      advantage to their brands.</span>
          <h3>SailFlow</h3>
          <h4>Overview :</h4>
          <span>SailFlow is designer with sailors in mind, meaning the web application
      has one purpose. This leaves room for competitors to create a web application
      for sailing and more. Users have felt the website and app to be too crowded
      and not user-friendly.</span>
          <h4>Key Objectives :</h4>
          <span>"Weather where you sail." SailFlow claims to be the #1 most trusted
      sailing weather source. Providing real-time updates from a multitude of
      weather stations, LIVE WIND feature and giving onsite reports from sailors
      around the world.</span>
          <h2>Surveys & Interviews</h2>
          <p>In order to get a general idea of the type of user personas I
      would need to create for Vela I condudted a series of interviews and surveys.
      I held in-person and remote interviews with 3 participants and conducted a
      survey through Google Forms that resulted in 10-15 responses.
          <h4>Interview Goals</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Identify user patterns and behaviors around the activity of
      surfing.</li>
            <li>Determine which features and functions users would use on a
      weather app.</li>
            <li>Discover users' concerns and pain points on a weather app.</li>
            <li>Collect data on how and why users might use a weather predction
      app.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Interview Questions</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>At what level would you consider your surfing and approximately
      how long have you been surfing?</li>
            <li>How often do you check weather reports before going to surf,
      if ever?</li>
            <li>Are you currently or have you ever previously used a weather
      prediction app, other than weather.com to check the weather before you go
      surfing?</li>
            <li>If so, is there anything you would change about the application?
      If not, would you ever consider using one?</li>
            <li>Have you ever used an application to record your surf session?
      If not, would you be open to it, to allow other surfers to get real-time
      updates?</li>
            <li>What information do you consider crucial or important to any
      surfer when planning a session?</li>
            <li>How can you tell if the weather being reported in reliable?</li>
            <li>If you were to use a weather prediction application for surfing
      are there any specific feature you would want to see on it other than
      predicting the weather?</li>
            <li>What would be the ideal layout to make reading the weather
      easy and simple for you as a user?</li>
            <li>How much level of preparation would you say goes into getting
      ready to surf?</li>
            <li>What would you consider at the bottom of your checklist when
      preparing to surf?</li>
            <li>Would you like to be a part of a surf community that allows
      you to share data on surf sessions, competitions or surfing locations?</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Insights Gathered</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Majority of surfers interviewed consider themselves moderate/
      intermediate and have been surfing for 10+ years.</li>
            <li>The intermediate or advanced surfers would always check weather
      reports before getting in the water.</li>
            <li>The most important information to them is the size of the swell,
      direction of wind, air/water temperature and if it is high or low tide.</li>
            <li>None of the potential users have ever used an applicaton to record
      surf sessions but the majority were open to the application feature.</li>
            <li>The addition of a live camera feature was suggested by two out
      of the three potential users during interviews.</li>
            <li>No more than 2 hours goes into preparing to surf.</li>
            <li>Potential users who have used other applications for weather
      predictions felt it was difficult to find the actual reports, they had to
      spend a few minutes looking or scrolling to find them.</li>
            <li>Majority of potential users would join a surf community if it
      was a feature on the application.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>User Personas & Journey Maps</h2>
          <p>Having gathered information and data from my market research,
      surveys and interviews I was able to create 2 user personas that reflected
      the different types of personalities that might use Vela. Using my user
      personas I created 2 journey maps that represented some of the main functions
      of the application.</p>

          <p>Based on my user personas I created a first iteration sitemap that

      sorting method I was able to create a second iteration sitemap that better
      represented the applications navigation.</p>

          <h2>Usability Tests</h2>
          <p>After sketching out and designing my screens for the main user
      flows, I created an interactive prototype with Adobe XD to conduct usability
      test with 6 participants. Using moderated in-person and remote testing I
      was able to observe the behavior patterns of my participants while they
      completed the takss and navigated the prototype.</p>

          <p>Using a rainbow spreadsheet I was able to organize all of my data
      gathered during my usability tests. I received great feedback from my
      participants and found points of friction within my application where errors
      were made. Using these findings I redesigned sections of my web application
      to improve the quality and functionality of it.</p>
