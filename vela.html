          <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
          <p>Our weather app users need a way to check current weather related
      predictions because they need to unsure their safety for the day they chose
      to participate in a water related activity or sport.

      We will know this to be true when we see how many users are checking the
      current weather conditions.</p>
          <h3>My Role</h3>
          <p>Researcher - Interviewer - Designer</p>
          <h3>Duration</h3>
          <p>10 months</p>

          <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
          <span>To understand the market for applications that predict the weather
      for water sports I needed to conduct a competitive analysis of pre-existing
      applications. I chose Surfline and SailFlow for their similarity in function
      and their popularity amongst users.
          <h3>Surfline</h3>

          <h3>Overview :</h3>
          <p>While Surfline is no doubt a top-dog in marine weather forecasting,
      it seems to really only cater to the needs of surfers and fisherman.
      However, being a weall-known source some users feel it has lost its
      oringinality and become too commercial.

          <h3>Key Objectives</h3>
          <p>"Connecting people with their passion." Surfline/Wavetrak has been
      a long standing network used by surfers and boaters alike. Having their
      own products and a team of expert meteorologists and scientists adds an
      advantage to their brands.</p>
